# theEvenOddChallenge
### A Techgig Hackathon Challenge. 
##### What the program does:
  1. First input: Takes a number T that stands for the number of tests to be run.
      - it should be between 1 and 10
  2. Second input: Takes a string  S of alphabets
      - Expects lowercase but can also handle upppercase by converting it to lowercase
      - STRICTLY alphabets
      - String should be between 2 to 1000 characters long 
  3. The program computes the absolute difference between ASCII values of odd indexed characters and even indexed characters 
  4. If the modulus for absolute difference and prime numbers between 1 and 0 which are (3,5,7) is Zero then it is a "Prime string"
  5. If the modulus for absolute difference and prime numbers between 1 and 0 which are (3,5,7) is any other number then it is a "Casual string"

###### Running the Program:
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Run the program in the terminal. Change directory to the program directory
  3. Assuming you have Python already installed run the below command
      `py run.py`
